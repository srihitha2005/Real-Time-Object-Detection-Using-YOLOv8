# Traffic Signs Detection using YOLOv8

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting traffic signs using YOLOv8. The model is trained on a traffic sign dataset and can accurately detect and classify various traffic signs in real-time from images and video streams.

## Features
- Real-time traffic sign detection
- Trained on a traffic sign dataset
- Supports both image and video input
- High-speed inference with YOLOv8
- Customizable for different traffic sign datasets

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy torch torchvision
```

## Dataset
